# Ericas-Daily-Planner

## Description 
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day (in my case, 6am to 2pm). It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library, and also uses local storage to make sure saved events persist even when the page is refreshed.
